    Lexical Tokens : The low-level language elements like Identifiers, numbers, operators, special characters.

    Identifiers : A name in a program is called an identifier. Are used to denote classes, methods, variables and labels.

    Volatile : Volatile keyword is used to indicate that a variable's value may be modified by a multiple threads
               simultaneously. It ensures that the variable is always read from and written to the main memory,
               rather than from thread-specific cache.

    Serialization : Serialization in java is the concept of representing an object's state as a byte stream. The byte
                    stream has all the information about the object. Serialization in java helps transport the code
                    from one JVM to another and then de-serialize it there.

    Transient : Transient is a java keyword which marks a member variable not to be serialized when it is persisted
                to streams of bytes.

    Separators : are like { , } , [ , ] , ( , ) , . , ; , , , ... , @ , :: .

    Literals : A literal denotes a constant value; that means the value that a literal represents remain unchanged
               in the program. Literal represent numerical (integer and floating-point), character, boolean, and
               string values. In addition, the literal null represents the null reference.

    Decimal Numbers : Decimal number system is also "Base 10", because it's based on the number 10, with these 10 symbols:
                0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and 9 but notice there is no symbol for 10. 10 is actually two symbols put together,
                a "1" and a "0":

    Binary Numbers : are just "Base 2" instead of "Base 10".

    Hexadecimal Numbers : There are 16 of them 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F
